About data sources
==================

This section contains documentation about the contents of various data
sources.  This is not strictly a task of niimpy: niimpy analyzes any data
streams, and you should find the best documentation of the input data
from wherever you get that data, and then combine that source
knowledge with niimpy analysis documentation to do what you need.

But still, the niimpy developers have their own data sources, and it
is useful to include all this information in one place (when we don't
have a better place to put it).  Other third-party data sources could
also be documented here if it proves useful to someone.
